# 📊 Customer Service Dashboard  

## 🚀 Overview  
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of **Customer Service performance**, transforming complex data into actionable insights. It includes metrics for **response requests, resolution time, and customer interactions**, helping improve efficiency and service quality.  

## ✅ SLA Compliance
This dashboard adopts a high-performance standard by setting the SLA threshold at 3 days, in alignment with best practices in customer service. While the legal maximum response time in Brazil is 7 days (as defined by Decree No. 11.034/2022), this dashboard goes further by applying a more rigorous benchmark.

All service requests were resolved within this 3-day window, resulting in a 100% SLA compliance rate. This not only demonstrates operational consistency but also reinforces the team's commitment to delivering fast and reliable support.

### 🟢 SLA Compliance: 100% “All service requests were resolved within 3 days, demonstrating consistent SLA compliance and operational efficiency.”

This metric is displayed prominently in the dashboard to communicate service excellence and build trust with stakeholders.

 ## 📐 DAX Measures
Custom DAX formulas were crafted to enhance time intelligence and performance tracking:

### 📊 Request & Response Metrics

Average Time = 
AVERAGEX(
    fOcorrencias,
    fOcorrencias[Resolution Date] - fOcorrencias[Request Date]
)

### Total Open Requests
````
Open requests = COUNT(fOcorrencias[Request Date])
````
### Total Response Requests
````
Response Request = CALCULATE(
    COUNT(fOcorrencias[Resolution Date]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(dcalendar[Date], fOcorrencias[Resolution Date])

````
### ⏱️ Time Intelligence

### Average Daily Requests
````
Average Daily Requests = 
VAR vworkdays = DISTINCTCOUNT(fOcorrencias[Request Date])
RETURN DIVIDE([Open requests], vworkdays)
````
### Average Daily Responses
````
Average Daily Responses = 
VAR vworkdays = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(fOcorrencias[Resolution Date]),
    USERELATIONSHIP(dcalendar[Date], fOcorrencias[Resolution Date])
)
RETURN DIVIDE([Response Request], vworkdays)
````
### Average Response Time (in Minutes)
````
Average Response Time = 
AVERAGE(fOcorrencias[Resolution Time (s)]) * 24 * 60
````
### Average Response (Formatted as mm:ss)
````
Average Response = 
VAR TotalTime = AVERAGE(fOcorrencias[Resolution Time (s)])
VAR InteireDay = INT(TotalTime)
VAR HorasRestantes = (TotalTime - InteireDay) * 24
VAR HorasInteiras = INT(HorasRestantes)
VAR MinutosRestantes = (HorasRestantes - HorasInteiras) * 60
VAR MinutosInteiros = INT(MinutosRestantes)
VAR SegundosRestantes = (MinutosRestantes - MinutosInteiros) * 60
VAR SegundosInteiros = ROUND(SegundosRestantes, 0)
RETURN FORMAT(MinutosInteiros, "00") & "m and " & FORMAT(SegundosInteiros, "00") & "s"
````
### Chart Total Response Time (as numeric mmss)
````
Chart Total Response Time = 
VAR TotalTime = AVERAGE(fOcorrencias[Resolution Time (s)])
VAR HorasRestantes = TotalTime * 24
VAR HorasInteiras = INT(HorasRestantes)
VAR MinutosRestantes = (HorasRestantes - HorasInteiras) * 60
VAR MinutosInteiros = INT(MinutosRestantes)
VAR SegundosRestantes = (MinutosRestantes - MinutosInteiros) * 60
VAR SegundosInteiros = ROUND(SegundosRestantes, 0)
RETURN VALUE(FORMAT(MinutosInteiros, "00") & FORMAT(SegundosInteiros, "00"))
````
### Response Time (Formatted as dd hh mm ss)
````
Response Time = 
VAR TotalTime = SUM(fOcorrencias[Resolution Time (s)])
VAR InteireDay = INT(TotalTime)
VAR HorasRestantes = (TotalTime - InteireDay) * 24
VAR HorasInteiras = INT(HorasRestantes)
VAR MinutosRestantes = (HorasRestantes - HorasInteiras) * 60
VAR MinutosInteiros = INT(MinutosRestantes)
VAR SegundosRestantes = (MinutosRestantes - MinutosInteiros) * 60
VAR SegundosInteiros = ROUND(SegundosRestantes, 0)
RETURN
FORMAT(InteireDay, "00") & " Day(s)       " &
FORMAT(HorasInteiras, "00") & " Hour(s)       " &
FORMAT(MinutosInteiros, "00") & " Minute(s)       " &
FORMAT(SegundosInteiros, "00") & " Second(s)"
